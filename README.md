# Diana Deluvian
### A MERN stack developer

Hi, I am a trans woman living in Sweden with a passion for SPAs. My professional ambitions are to become a compotent senior developer, able to handle any and
all projects, and deliver sleek, functional products as a result. I am currently looking for an organisation that would help me grow as a developer, and I, in turn,
help deliver real-world applications at an industry-grade level. 

Beyond the front and back end, I am also interested in Digital Design, networks, servers, and hosting, and functional programming paradigms. 

My personal website is: [Diana Deluvian](https://diana-deluvian.com)

My latest project is: [Diana's Kitchenette](https://dianas-kitchenette.com)
